Sharepoint Joel is one of the most knowledgeable sharepoint people on the planet. His site has helped me so much in the past. Here are some great links for troubleshooting sharepoint 2010. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sharepointjoel.com/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=280&#34; title=&#34;10 tips for troubleshooting 2010&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://www.sharepointjoel.com/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=280&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
::qa::lurn::qa::Static NGINX Locations::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2015/04/01/2015-04-01-NGINX-Static-Locations/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;I try to get a lot of mileage out of the single AWS t2.micro instance I keep running,&lt;br&gt;which means I have many different projects running on different paths on a single server.  Everytime I finish a project, I have to relearn how to add new “locations” (paths) to the NGINX virtual host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really frustrated when I couldn’t figure out how to add a static location for the Jekyll&lt;br&gt;website I created for the game I’m developing.  I kept trying to do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;location / {
  root /home/ubuntu/personal-website;
}
location /array {
  root /home/ubuntu/array-website/_site;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;But everytime I tried to visit [&lt;a href=&#34;http://ptsteadman.com/array]&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://ptsteadman.com/array]&lt;/a&gt;, I would get a 404 error.&lt;br&gt;I tried a bunch of things: I changed the “root” of the the &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; location to my game website, and it worked.  But no matter what I did, after using &lt;code&gt;sudo service nginx restart&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;br&gt;trying to visit the &lt;code&gt;/array&lt;/code&gt; location still resulted in a 404.  I couldn’t add the new route/location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I realized that the text after the slash in the location is the directory that&lt;br&gt;NGINX will try to find in the “root” location.  So, &lt;code&gt;location /array&lt;/code&gt; will look for the directory (or file)&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;array&lt;/code&gt; in whatever directory “root” is set to.  So, I created a symlink to the root of my&lt;br&gt;static jekyll site with the command &lt;code&gt;ln -s /home/ubuntu/array-website/_site /home/ubuntu/array&lt;/code&gt;, and&lt;br&gt;then I could set up my nginx config file in &lt;code&gt;sites-enabled&lt;/code&gt; as below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;location / {
  root /home/ubuntu/personal-website;
}
location /array {
  root /home/ubuntu;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this stuff is all pretty obvious to someone who really understands NGINX and file serving,&lt;br&gt;but I only touch NGINX when I’ve finished a project and feel impatient to deploy.  I think it’s very confusing&lt;br&gt;that NGINX seems to handle paths differently between &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; locations and and &lt;code&gt;/foo&lt;/code&gt; locations,&lt;br&gt;but a real understanding of NGINX might clear things up.&lt;/p&gt;

::qa::lurn::qa::Spaces for Newline Indents in VS::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2015/03/23/2015-03-23-Make-VS-Insert-Spaces/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;It’s really annoying when Visual Studio shows you this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://ptsteadman.github.io/images/vs1.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But github or vim shows you the same file like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://ptsteadman.github.io/images/vim1.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use the “show whitespace” Visual Studio chord &lt;code&gt;(CTRL-R, CTRL-W)&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;br&gt;you’ll see that visual studio inserts tabs instead of spaces by&lt;br&gt;default for newline indent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://ptsteadman.github.io/images/ws.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual Studio displays tabs as having the same&lt;br&gt;width as four spaces.  But if you’re collaborating with someone working&lt;br&gt;in another text editor like vim, your automatically-inserted tabs will&lt;br&gt;appear larger than four spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to make visual studio insert spaces instead of tabs on newline indents:&lt;br&gt;go to &lt;code&gt;Tools-&amp;gt;Options-&amp;gt;Text Editor-&amp;gt;All Languages-&amp;gt;Tabs&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;http://ptsteadman.github.io/images/spaces.png&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s better:&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, he shows how to create Web Service references in .NET using the now-deprecated Web Refrence method (from .NET 2) instead of the more current Service Reference method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/freddyk/archive/2010/01/20/connecting-to-nav-web-services-from-c-using-service-reference-config-file-version.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Using Service Reference to Connect to Web Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;This explains how to use Service Reference, using code instead of XML web.config configuration, which I found difficult to configure.  (Each time I updated the service reference, I would have to reconfigure the XML).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;NAV-Upgrade-Process&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#NAV-Upgrade-Process&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;NAV Upgrade Process:&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;NAV Upgrade Process:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://saurav-nav.blogspot.com/2012/12/nav-2013-upgrade-part-iv-sql-migration.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Migration to SQL Server from C/SIDE Database&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to use web services, you don’t need to be using the Role Tailored Client, but you must be using the a SQL server based NAV database.  Web Services can be configured and exposed using the Classic Client for SQL Server Databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/nav/archive/2012/03/05/rtc-debugging.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Debugging Code Called by Web Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;C/AL code won’t necessarily execute the same as it did in the Classic Client when called  as a Web Service.  C/AL code called as web service execute in the NAV Server tier, instead of the client.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff477107.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Certain functions&lt;/a&gt; aren’t available for code running in the NAV Server, and some design changes need to be made (for example, CONFIRM dialogue boxes don’t make sense in the context of a web service).  To debug the codeunits called through web services (or the Role Tailored Client), you will need to use Visual Studio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd338765.aspx#SU&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;More information.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;Deploying-a-NET-Application&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Deploying-a-NET-Application&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Deploying a .NET Application:&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Deploying a .NET Application:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/deployment/visual-studio-web-deployment/deploying-to-iis&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Deploying to IIS&lt;/a&gt;  After you’ve built a .NET application that consumes .NET web services, you’ll have to find a way to deploy it on your servers, or Azure.  Connection strings can be used to specify different NAV servers for different environments (like development, QA, and prod).&lt;/p&gt;
::qa::lurn::qa::Adding Lookup Field to a Page in Dynamics NAV::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2015/04/05/2015-04-05-Lookup-on-Page/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;One of the problems I faced in building a non-trivial application that consumed&lt;br&gt;NAV Web Services was figuring out how to “join” fields from different tables.&lt;br&gt;For example, when exposing a list of jobs from a job table which includes a&lt;br&gt;resource needed for the job, you might need more than just the resource id&lt;br&gt;that’s a field in the table: you might also need the resource name and&lt;br&gt;description.  While this is easy to get for one record, what about when you&lt;br&gt;need a few hundred records in a table that has been dynamically filtered?  When&lt;br&gt;exposing a Page as a web service, it’s easy to include the fields of the table&lt;br&gt;that the page is based on, but it’s less clear how to include fields from&lt;br&gt;another table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forum posts like &lt;a href=&#34;http://dynamicsuser.net/forums/p/32550/170843.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; led me to believe that I couldn’t expose flow fields in a Page web service, and I would get exceptions when I tried to expose all the fields of a table.  In fact, it’s perfectly possible to expose a flow field: it’s &lt;strong&gt;flow filters&lt;/strong&gt; that don’t work with web services.  But, I also didn’t want to modify the underlying [job] table to add a flow field, and didn’t see an easy way of adding a flow field to a Page.  I tried “joining” the data in the C# application, but found network overhead made the application unusuably slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to this problem was to use C/AL code to the Page to effectively create a lookup / flow field.  This way, the data is “pre-joined” before leaving the NAV Server, which is fast and clean, but you didn’t modify any tables.  Here’s how it’s done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1. &lt;strong&gt;Add a Field with SourceExpression Set to a Function Name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, we create a Page using the wizard that includes all of the fields of an underlying table.  Then, we create manually add fields that will contain the lookup data from other tables.  The text in the SourceExpression column will be the name of the function that populates this field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ptsteadman.github.io/images/lookup-1.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;Add a Field with SourceExpression Set to a Function Name&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2. &lt;strong&gt;Create Function in the Page’s C/AL Code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Page field designer open, go to the functions tab of C/AL Globals form, and add a function with the name of the text in the SourceExpression column.  Set the return type of the function with the “Locals” button, and a function trigger will appear in the C/AL code editor for your page.  Add code to the body of the function trigger that will be called for each record to provide a value for the field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ptsteadman.github.io/images/lookup-2.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;Create Function in the Page&amp;#39;s C/AL Code&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015 it makes sense to use NVM.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://linoxide.com/ubuntu-how-to/install-node-js-ubuntu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;NVM Installation&lt;br&gt;Instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update NPM: &lt;code&gt;npm install npm@latest -g&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hexo: why can’t you use helper functions in source code?&lt;br&gt;This should be in docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;Creating-a-Custom-Index-File-in-Hexo&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Creating-a-Custom-Index-File-in-Hexo&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Creating a Custom Index File in Hexo&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Creating a Custom Index File in Hexo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trying to generate a custom index file in source, hexo would ignore&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;source/index.md&lt;/code&gt; no matter what I did.  What I had to do was uninstall&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;hexo-generator-index&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hexojs/hexo/issues/1077&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;See&lt;br&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Then it works.  So, that&lt;br&gt;will be part of the setup for my theme.  But, it’s worth it in order to properly&lt;br&gt;seperate the theme from the content, I think.  Having everyone edit the theme&lt;br&gt;index.ejs template is no good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;Hexo-Rendering-Raw-EJS-File-Problem-I-Encountered&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Hexo-Rendering-Raw-EJS-File-Problem-I-Encountered&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Hexo Rendering Raw EJS File Problem I Encountered&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hexo Rendering Raw EJS File Problem I Encountered&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the server would keep rendering an old version of my code, but as&lt;br&gt;text.  So I’d see stuff like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;% if (site.tags.length){ %&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The raw ejs, essentially.  Restarting the server or running &lt;code&gt;hexo clean&lt;/code&gt; didn’t&lt;br&gt;do anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some time, I realized it was due to the gedit swap files being read by&lt;br&gt;hexo as the actual layout files: for example, &lt;code&gt;tag.ejs~&lt;/code&gt;.  My &lt;code&gt;partial&lt;/code&gt; helpers&lt;br&gt;looked like: &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;%- partial(&amp;#39;_partials/tag&amp;#39;) %&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and apparently hexo was reading&lt;br&gt;in &lt;code&gt;tag.ejs~&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;tag.ejs&lt;/code&gt;.  And therefore, the ejs wasn’t rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fix this, I simply changed my partial helper to &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;%-
partial(&amp;#39;_partials/tag.ejs&amp;#39;) %&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.  Problem solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;Hexo-Excerpt-Variable&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Hexo-Excerpt-Variable&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Hexo Excerpt Variable&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hexo Excerpt Variable&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was confused by the behavior of the hexo &lt;code&gt;excerpt&lt;/code&gt; variable.  If you define&lt;br&gt;&lt;code&gt;excerpt: something&lt;/code&gt; in the front matter, hexo ignores that.  Instead, to get it&lt;br&gt;to work, one needs to add a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!-- more --&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; comment in the source of the post.&lt;br&gt;Or, you can install a plugin that allows you to define custom excerpt in the&lt;br&gt;front matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;Scripts-Directory&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#Scripts-Directory&#34; class=&#34;headerlink&#34; title=&#34;Scripts Directory&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Scripts Directory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things I really discovered too late is the “Scripts” directory in the&lt;br&gt;theme folder.  In Hexo, the various plugins drive the structure of the site, as&lt;br&gt;opposed to the placement of different files and directories, as in Jekyll.  The&lt;br&gt;plugins programatically create folder structure, etc, where in Jekyll I mostly&lt;br&gt;used the liquid markup to structure the site.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is, then, that the user wants to extend hexo to do some sort of&lt;br&gt;custom thing.  If one had to publish a new plugin, that’d be too much work.  But&lt;br&gt;the theme level scripts folder allows one to extend the base hexo functionality&lt;br&gt;in ‘user space’ effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Top tech talent knows that industry recruiters often bring a stack of&lt;br&gt;pre-negotiated offers to university infosessions, so that they can snag&lt;br&gt;programmers and UX designers who really stand out.  Instead of spending valuable&lt;br&gt;time validating a particularly promising candidate’s skillset through a&lt;br&gt;protracted series of interviews, it’s often more efficient to simply &lt;strong&gt;give the&lt;br&gt;individual an offer right then and there&lt;/strong&gt;.  Internal studies at Google have shown&lt;br&gt;that experienced recruiters can usually tell if a programmer has ‘what it takes’&lt;br&gt;just from how they act at infosessions: the insightful questions they ask, the&lt;br&gt;stickers on their laptop, and how they comport themselves in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of tips for optimizing your infosession performance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask questions to get a feel for the company’s culture.  For example, I always&lt;br&gt;start off by asking “do you have a mandatory drug test?”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure that the recruiters know you’re passionate about the company by&lt;br&gt;crying.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t be that awkward guy who goes up for more pizza while the presenter is&lt;br&gt;providing valuable information about the company’s agile development cycle.&lt;br&gt;Instead, demonstrate your ability to amortize I/O costs via bulk loading:&lt;br&gt;bring a whole box of pizza back to your seat.  Protip: “free swag” t-shirts&lt;br&gt;make great face rags, so grab a handful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay focused by minimizing distractions.  I typically wear my Bose&lt;br&gt;QuietComfort noise cancelling headphones during the presentation.  This way I&lt;br&gt;retain more information from the PowerPoint, which really impresses the&lt;br&gt;recruiters during the networking session.  Follow me on Spotify to check out&lt;br&gt;my special “Let’s Do This Infosession” playlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting invited to the ‘after-infosession’ is critical.  During the networking&lt;br&gt;session, ask the recruiters what hotel they’re staying at, and make sure that&lt;br&gt;they know that you ‘know a guy’.  Without fail, someone will slip a wax-sealed&lt;br&gt;envelope under your door at midnight, the coveted invitation to an another, more&lt;br&gt;exclusive networking event.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you follow these simple tips and brush up on your data structures, you’ll&lt;br&gt;soon be literally &lt;em&gt;drowning&lt;/em&gt; in offers, like everyone else.  If these tips don’t&lt;br&gt;work out for you, you probably need to get your MEng.&lt;/p&gt;
::qa::lurn::qa::401 unauthorized::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2008/10/25/401-unauthorized/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;so all of a sudden i can’t get into mysites. i get the 401 unauthorized and i am totally baffled. I tried deleting the search scopes and re crawling all content. Nothing. I am stumped. Does this mean i have to call MS? I am actually still researching this behavior. I do have a full backup of the mysite configuration for a week ago but i am not sure if i can install over the top of this. This all happened after we patched the servers last week. here are some links: &lt;a href=&#34;http://spforsquirrels.blogspot.com/2007/12/sharepoint-search-does-not-crawl-people.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://spforsquirrels.blogspot.com/2007/12/sharepoint-search-does-not-crawl-people.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.msdn.com/cjohnson/archive/2006/09/15/754902.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://blogs.msdn.com/cjohnson/archive/2006/09/15/754902.aspx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://gpeiris.blogspot.com/2007/03/event-id-6482-7888-6398-7076-errors.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://gpeiris.blogspot.com/2007/03/event-id-6482-7888-6398-7076-errors.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://gpeiris.blogspot.com/2007/03/event-id-6482-7888-6398-7076-errors.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success! i was able to figure out what to do to fix it. But i am baffled as to why it happened.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some reason the root sps3 site was erased. This is a mystery and i can’t figure out how it go deleted. SO i created another mysite template host site and boom it worked.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something happened when we patched the server that deleted it i think. I am not sure how else you can accidentally delete the root site.&lt;/p&gt;
::qa::lurn::qa::55706649::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2008/10/21/55706649/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;So, what’s up with user profiles? Is there any easy way to administer them. I really would like to know an easy way to upload profilepics for all users.&lt;/p&gt;
::qa::lurn::qa::55201929::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2008/10/18/55201929/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;I successully installed MOSS2007 on windows 2008 and SQL 2008 all running on 2 virtual machines. Yes it can be done.! Yes it does work.&lt;/p&gt;
::qa::lurn::qa::Access denied, can&#39;t crawl web application.::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2011/06/30/access-denied-cant-crawl-web-application/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;This strange incident just happened on a brand new farm. I was able to crawl, mysites and cthub, but for whatever reason my &lt;a href=&#34;http://portal&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://portal&lt;/a&gt; url was un-crawlable. I took to the google and found a bunch of post stating the famed disableloopback reg edit suggested by the forum gods: Click Start, click Run, type regedit, and then click OK. In Registry Editor, locate and then click the following registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa Right-click Lsa, point to New, and then click DWORD Value. Type DisableLoopbackCheck, and then press ENTER. Right-click DisableLoopbackCheck, and then click Modify. In the Value data box, type 1, and then click OK. Quit Registry Editor, and then restart your computer. THIS DID NOT SOLVE MY PROBLEM. I was still getting access denied. So why is the cthub web app yield successful crawls but not the portal web app? So my next step was just to create a random web app with a random port number, detach the portal content database, attach it to random web app and crawl. It totally worked. So i configured AAM on random web app to &lt;a href=&#34;http://portal&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://portal&lt;/a&gt;, added the name of the new web app to the content source (along with sps3) and crawled again. Content started flowing like water. Why did it do this? I do not know, but at least search works.   nando&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately for me, I have windows 2008 and IIS7.

Who knew? Microsoft what the hell man? We aren’t mind readers, way to let us know! Read to the bottom of the KB article and you will see an obscure entry down there referring to system.webserver entry you must include in your web.config file. WOW. Thank god i have no life, otherwise i would have never found it! Nando&lt;/p&gt;

The symptom was strange: Subscriptions to alerts DID work but subsequent alerts did not. I looked everywhere. Finally I found something in the sql table called dbo.TimerLock. Timer lock by a front end server. I rebooted the server and ran the following commands: 1.stsadm -o getproperty -pn search-alerts-enabled 2.stsadm -o getproperty -pn search-immediate-alerts 3.stsadm -o getproperty -pn search-daily-alerts 4.stsadm -o setproperty -pn search-alerts-enabled -pv “Yes” 5.stsadm -o setproperty -pn search-immediate-alerts -pv “Every 5 minutes between 0 and 59” 6.stsadm -o setproperty -pn search-daily-alerts -pv “Everyday between 00:00:00 and 05:00:00”&lt;/p&gt;

::qa::lurn::qa::Application Registry Service...what is it? what happens if i delete the db?::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2010/11/24/application-registry-service-what-is-it-what-happens-if-i-delete-the-db/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;The application registry service enables users to search and collaborate around business data and provides backward compatibility to BDC service. During my sharepoint 2010 travels, I cam across an interesting issue. In an effort to rename databases to something other the “wss_dbname_reallylongguidthatmakesnosense”, i deleted this database and forgot about it for some time. Low and behold, the application registry service still shows as started and runs happily, or so it seems. I am sure the logs are screaming some bloody murder, but the Central Admin console is just perfectly fine running. Why is this? If I deleted a database, shouldn’t sharepoint be screaming at me with some cryptic message? Apparently not until I actually connect to a BDC service with MOSS 2007 or, I try to manually backup the farm. Either way, there is a way to fix this. Obviously, you can recreate the database using powershell, but, I don’t know how to do that yet fluently, so I took the easy approach. 1. First I deleted the application registry service. 2. Then I clicked on the wizard. The wizard is kind of nifty, because it tells you with choices what service application can be installed. Low and behold, the ARS is one of them. So I clicked on it and continued. 3. I decided to skip the whole creating a new site collection, since I already had one and success, the ARS db is happily back in sql with its ridiculous long guid name. Happy time.&lt;/p&gt;

Newform.aspx urls. Sure they live in the document library ribbon. Sure you can also just drag stuff in, but what if you want to create a custom page and make it even easier for your users to create a new document? That’s not so easy. So i set about figuring out the best way to do this. Javascript buttons look cool and professional, so I thought, hey why not. So I scoured the interwebs for some code. I came across this Gem by Ahmed Farag: &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/how24/2014/09/23/create-a-link-to-display-edit-and-create-new-items-from-a-dialog-layover-in-sharepoint/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/how24/2014/09/23/create-a-link-to-display-edit-and-create-new-items-from-a-dialog-layover-in-sharepoint/&lt;/a&gt; Thanks Ahmed you got me started! This is an elegant solution if your library is out of the box. But what if you have custom content types? That is not so easy to figure out. Once i did figure it out it was easy but not at first. You see, if you add a custom content type to a document library, the content type lives in _layouts, not in list/library name. So how do you link that? Well my friends, I am glad you asked. First things first, like Ahmed says, grab yourself a content editor webpart (not script editor, that one has issues) and add it to a page. Open your fav notepad editor Copy Mr. Farag’s elegant code into it and click save.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(script type=&amp;quot;text/javascript&amp;quot;)
 function displayLayover(url) { 
 var options = SP.UI.$create_DialogOptions(); 
 options.url = url; 
 options.dialogReturnValueCallback = Function.createDelegate( 
 null, null); 
 SP.UI.ModalDialog.showModalDialog(options); 
 } 
 (/script)
Upload to your site asset library and link it via web part editor propeties


&amp;lt;a href=&amp;apos;javascript:displayLayover(&amp;quot;/Lists/Contacts/NewForm.aspx?IsDlg=1&amp;quot;)&amp;apos;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;That will open your new item in a page, where, gasp, you can copy the url and past it into Ahmed code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;apos;javascript:displayLayover(&amp;quot;http://mysharepoint.domain.com/_layouts/15/NewDocSet.aspx?List=bc691a02%2D6335%2D4aee%2Da0e8%2D70185ab0491e&amp;amp;Source=http%3A%2F%2site%2Edomain%2Edomain%2Ecom%2F15%2Fnewlibrary%2FForms%2FAllItems%2Easpx&amp;amp;ContentTypeId=0x0120D520006B5814CAEDD0FD4C8F8F5C6B8AD7978C00F45CB6B8B2D5A74C8046CA70881BB0F7&amp;amp;RootFolder=%2F15%2Fputthisinyournewlibrary&amp;quot;)&amp;apos;&amp;gt;New Content Type
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tips: Make sure when you use content editor you upload your code to the asset library and link the file inside the content editor, so you can edit it easier.

Here is what i have found so far: 1. The KPI List (or any view other than “All Items” view) is a customized list view and can’t be sorted and will always be in the order in which the KPIs were added. 2. ‘Modify This View’ will let you change the sort order and that gets applied only to the ‘All Items’ View.&lt;/p&gt;

::qa::lurn::qa::Dissapearing Contacts! A Document Library Ballad.::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2008/11/11/dissapearing-contacts-a-document-library-ballad/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;Yes you heard right! Email contacts created by sharepoint for document libraries are aribitrarily dissapearing. I can literally see them dissapear but i can’t for the life of me figure it out.&lt;br&gt;This is a new problem. In the past we have been able to email DLs no problem. This started happening out of the blue last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried to turn off incoming email, saved settings and re enabled incoming email settings. Sharepoint then creates the appropriate contact in the appropriate OU and then a few minutes later poof! its gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recreated one of the weekend, and thought it was all good but this morning it was gone again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have stopped and restarted teh smtp service on my front end. I have rebooted the machine all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have installed MOSS 2007 and added SP1 to it recently, but the emails where still flowing after the install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not all contacts are gone. Only a few that get used heavily. So i am flabergasted. Can anyone help?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT:&lt;br&gt;It seems that when i send an email to a specific library it deleltes the contact from the AD contact OU, in other words, sending the email to the library makes the contact dissapear; atleast it seems that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT:&lt;br&gt;SUCCESS!!!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally fixed this issue. All I had to restart the Sharepoint tracing service on all my front end servers. That seems to have solved the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems like i tried that before, but it never seemed to work. But i can’t remember if i did them for all front ends.&lt;/p&gt;

::qa::lurn::qa::Document Center and Content Organizer::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2012/02/17/document-center-and-content-organizer/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;One of SharePoint 2010’s hidden gems is the combo document center and content organizer. By default the Document Center has a nifty Upload Document Button, but it goes to the standard document library. You can change that and point it to the Drop Off LIbrary that is produced when you enable the Content Organizer. All you have to do is change some javascript. Here is how: Edit the welcome page from Site Actions, and then click on the “Upload a Document” button. You will see this is actually just a content editor web part, so from the ribbon, under “Editing Tools” / “Format Text” click the HTML drop-down and then “Edit HTML Source”. Replace the reference to the “Documents” library with “DropOffLibrary” i.e.: &lt;div&gt;&lt;button onclick=&#34;javascript:OpenNewFormUrl(&#39;DropOffLibrary/Forms/upload.aspx&#39;);return false;&#34; type=&#34;submit&#34;&gt;&lt;nobr&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Upload a Document&#34; src=&#34;/_layouts/Images/uploaddoc.png&#34;&gt; &lt;span&gt;Upload a Document&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nobr&gt;&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Save or stop editing the page and your done! The “Upload a Document” button will now default to uploading document to the Drop Off Library!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Current sp version is 12.0.0.6318&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this happening?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok i found out how its happening. The regional settings of the site itself where set to time setting tijuana time.&lt;br&gt;Once i set it to the correct time zone and propagated to all sites, it worked. But how did they all get to that other time zone?&lt;br&gt;Isn’t the site collection general settings time zone supposed to override it all?&lt;br&gt;And what about mysites?

::qa::lurn::qa::Dynamic Link to a specific Infopath Form View using a SP Workflow::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2013/12/11/dynamic-link-to-a-specific-infopath-form-view-using-a-sp-workflow/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;I had a requirement to create an infopath form for a client for assigning security badges. Not a difficult thing to do, I said. But as I gathered the requirements, and confidently shook my head back and forth saying, YES WE CAN!, I realized something nagging in the back of my mind. I of course paid no attention to it and got to work on the infopath form. It was nothing complex, just a user input form and an approval section at the bottom for official use only. But then that a fore mentioned nagging feeling, finally surfaced. I was going to have to use infopath views to hide the official use only section from the user. Simple enough for infopath, but now i had to surface a link to that view in a custom workflow email. That one took a bit of investigation, but i found 2 solutions for this. I will give credit to both parties, but i had to combine them to create one DOJO worthy Solution. The first part of the solution can be found here.

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First in SharePoint Designer 2010 i created a simple condition :&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“if current item equals value then Email a user”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://sharepointdojo.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/step11.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://sharepointdojo.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/step11.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;step1&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the email editor I created a custom link and in the string builder i copied the following url and filled in the blanks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ServerName/SiteName/_layouts/FormServer.aspx?XmlLocation=_**\[INSERTLOOKUP\]**&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://ServerName/SiteName/_layouts/FormServer.aspx?XmlLocation=_**\[INSERTLOOKUP\]**&lt;/a&gt;_ &amp;amp;Source=http%3A%2F%2FServerName%2FSiteName%2FLibraryName%2FForms%2FAllItems%2Easpx&amp;amp;DefaultItemOpen=1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the string builder I clicked on add or change lookup and inserted the following in the _&lt;strong&gt;[INSERTLOOKUP]&lt;/strong&gt; _referenced above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Source = Current Item&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Field From Source = Server Relative url. &lt;a href=&#34;http://sharepointdojo.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/step3.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://sharepointdojo.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/step3.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;step3&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The new Url should look like this:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://sharepointdojo.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/step2.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://sharepointdojo.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/step2.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;step2&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I adde a reference to the hidden view using : &amp;amp;DefaultView=hiddenview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save and publish the Rule and test it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The url link should open the infopath form with the new default view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VOILINS……i mean voila. Enjoy Nando&lt;/p&gt;

Today I am going to show you how to use calculated fields to form an email address and a clickable link to send to that email address you just created. The ask was to create a custom list that had the following fields: Cost Code Address Location City State Phone Manager This information just happened to be avaialable in another SQL database, so rather than populate it it manually, I decided to go BCS all over that sucker. BUt, that’s not what we will talk about today. Once that information is safely in SharePoint via external contentype, I used 2 calculated columns to get the email and the mailto link. The first calculated column was used to concatenate the cost center and location to form the much needed address. So if you are following at home create 2 calculated columns. The first colum will take Cost Code and Location city, mash them together and spit out an email address the address in the following format &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:store40001portland@mystore.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;store40001portland@mystore.com&lt;/a&gt; Since i have no column named store, i will just hard code it in. Here is the email formula: =CONCATENATE(“STORE”,[Cost Center],Location_City,”@mystore.COM”) Now, to make it a clickable mailto link, i really had to mess with the html. For your second calc column add this formula: =CONCATENATE(“&lt;a href=&#34;mailto:&amp;quot;,EmailCalc,&amp;quot;&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Email&lt;/a&gt;“) You guessed it, EMAILCALC is the name of the first calc column. that’s it. Love me. Nando&lt;/p&gt;

One of them is the ability to email document libraries. It is very easy to setup. I have had email enabled libraries running for almost a year, and then suddenly it stopped working. No warnings, nothing. Emails where getting sent to the Drop folder, but they stayed there, going nowhere. I was baffled. I tried everything. IIS reset, new smpt server, rebooting, restarting timer service, etc. I started digging and came up with these steps that WORK! 1.First on the CA Incoming Email settings I “had” to select Advanced Mode and enter the location of the drop folder. 2. You will have to run stsadm.exe -o enumservices to get the exact full name for the Incoming Email service to list in the next step. 3. Then after that they had to stop my Incoming Email Service manually at the command prompt. They ran stsadm.exe -o -provisionservice -action start -servicetype “Name of your incoming mail service,Version, Culture, Publickeytoken “ Mine was “Microsoft.Sharepoint.Administration.SPIncomingEmailSerivce, Microsoft.Sharepoint, Version=14.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=71e9bce11e9429c” NOTE THIS ALL HAS TO BE IN QUOTES WHEN YOU RUN STSADM COMMAND. 4. And Finally the all important IISRESET. I still don’t know why it stopped working in the first place. I will say this is mighty fishy. make sure your timer service account has R/W permissions to the drop folder too. But other than that, this worked for me. Hope it works for you. peace out nando.&lt;/p&gt;

So if you have a sharepoint 2007 list and want to import into 2010 this is what you have to do: 1. download list to your computer- should be an stp file 2. rename file to cab 3. extract cab file using winzip or your favor cab extraction prog. 4. look for manifest.xml 5. open manifest.xml with any editor 6. look for the product version element. 3 is for wss or moss, 4 is for foundation and sharepoint 2010 7. save it as 4. 8. use cabmaker to recreate cab file. 9. rename cab file to stp. 10. if you installed winzip you might need to re show file extention:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Folder Options by clicking the Start button &lt;img src=&#34;http://res2.windows.microsoft.com/resbox/en/Windows%20Vista/main/4/f/4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33/4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33.png&#34; alt=&#34;Picture of the Start button&#34; title=&#34;Picture of the Start button&#34;&gt;, clicking Control Panel, clickingAppearance and Personalization, and then clicking Folder Options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the View tab, and then, under Advanced settings, do one of the following:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To hide file extensions, select the Hide extensions for known file types check box, and then click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To display file extensions, clear the Hide extensions for known file typescheck box, and then click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VOILA you should have it. Try it. IT works. I promise.   Nando&lt;/p&gt;

::qa::lurn::qa::Forgotten WFM Autogeneration Key? I got your back!::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2017/02/08/forgotten-wfm-autogeneration-key-i-got-your-back/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;You ever forget that stupid autogenerated certificate password to join a SharePoint Workflow Manager Farm? Did you ever inherit a SharePoint farm with no passwords and you need to leave and rejoin a wfm farm(happens alot). Or perhaps you want to scale out your WFM farm and do not have the password. I struggled with this one myself, and I am here to show you the way. There is no way to retrieve it, that i know of. But I can show you how to change it. Step 1 - DO NOT LEAVE THE WFM FARM! YOu can do this if you do leave the farm, but it will take the full DB Connection string to get this to work. Step 2-Open powershell on your WFM machine and run these commands to update WFM Auto generated key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS C:\&amp;gt; $autoGenerateKey = convertto-securestring ‘CertAutoGenKey123’  -asplaintext -force&lt;br&gt;PS C:\&amp;gt; Set-WFCertificateAutoGenerationKey  -WFFarmDBConnectionString ‘dbConnectionString’ -key $autoGenerateKey -Verbose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will change the certificate generation key most people set when they run WFM the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2- Update the Service bus key as well. You can’t do one without the other. From powershell type this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS C:\&amp;gt; $SBGenerateKey = convertto-securestring ‘CertAutoGenKey123’  -asplaintext -force&lt;br&gt;PS C:\&amp;gt;Set-SBCertificateAutogenerationKey-WFFarmDBConnectionString ‘dbConnectionString’ -key $autoGenerateKey -Verbose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it. You should now be able to join the server to the WFM farm. Microsoft does not make it easy to find this stuff, so i decided to help you all out. Love Nando&lt;/p&gt;
::qa::lurn::qa::GPOs and SharePoint 2013: The dance of the 2 left footed partners.::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2013/07/03/gpos-and-sharepoint-2013-the-dance-of-the-2-left-footed-partners/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;I recently was installing SharePoint 2013 at a customers site. I thought all was going well till i started hitting a brick wall of errors while installing SharePoint, some that i had seen, others that i haven’t. I started noticing some strange things as well, like the SharePoint Timer services mysteriously turning off and then giving me an error, telling me that the there was a logon failure.  I thought this was kinda weird, but i went in and updated the password and i got CLUE #1. The dialogue box was now telling me that my farm account now had rights to log on as a service. That set me off an alarm in my head and decided to ask my customer if he had any custom GPOs. Turns out they did, but he didn’t quite know all the different ones they had. Thus started a long winding road figuring out which GPOs did what. The end result was this: SharePoint 2013 service accounts need the following rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage audit and security log&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Debug Programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backup files and directories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log on as a service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log on as batch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these right can be found on the local security policy, but if you have GPOs in your AD these will be over written. What you have to do is kindly/gently/forcefully ask you friendly neighborhood AD guru to create a GPO that allows these rights to your SP Service accounts. Adding the ones above helped me.

Maybe its really a feature, although I am not sure. But here is the situation: You create a SPD 2010 workflow, set it to start automatically or when an item changes and publish it to your site. You log in with your system account and to test the workflow. You create something, but workflow does not kick off automatically. It seems you can only start it manually. This is no good. The FIX: Log on with any other account that has contribute permissions. Test the workflow. It works. Weird.&lt;/p&gt;

As we all know content makes or breaks a site, so I am struggling with both how much and what sort of content to include. Links are always great, but too many links and the user will get confused. What will make a user go to the sp site instead of calling? I guess my philosophy on the matter is, if there is an off chance a user will search for help first, then it merits creating this portal for them. With sharepont search, user can search for this info; atleast that is my hope. Anyone care to share their ideas on this?&lt;/p&gt;

If you are like me, you want SharePoint to be the most simple thing ever, however, if you are like me, it never ever happens that way. Take my current farm, by all standards it is one of the most solidly built farms ever (PLA), however, there are nuances to that I discover everyday. You think you have it all figured out and then one day you are on the phone with Premier support and they just take you to the wood shed. Such a thing happened to me, when i couldn’t get InfoPath browser forms to work in the browser when calling &lt;a href=&#34;http://jfsweb-uat/_vti_bin/UserProfileService.asmx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;_vti_bin/UserProfileService.asmx&lt;/a&gt; SOAP service. NO matter what I tried, or how many blogs I read, I kept getting the dreaded EVENT ID 5566. I followed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cdhtalkstech.com/2013/05/31/using-infopath-2013-to-query-data-from-the-user-profile-service-in-sharepoint-2013/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt; which got me very close, but not all the way, because of KERBEROS. Why Microsoft decided to name it after stuff animals is beyond me. What the blogs don’t tell you is that if you want to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://jfsweb-uat/_vti_bin/UserProfileService.asmx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;_vti_bin/UserProfileService.asmx&lt;/a&gt; SOAP service to get User Profile INFO, AND YOUR WEB APP AUTHENTICATION PROVIDER IS SET TO NEGOTIATE  you have to the following EXTRA STEPS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new Secure Store ID and set it to GROUP TICKET. GROUP TICKET is the key to this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The secure store credentials need to have the ability to READ Active Directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will need to convert your InfoPath form data connection into UDCX files, in infopath.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will need to create a data connection library and make sure you turn on content publishing  (just an option).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will need to edit the ucdx files just like in above reference blog, EXCEPT, and this is very important, INSTEAD OF NTLM set it to NEGOTIATE (after all this article start out by pointing that the farm is set to negotiate).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t use web proxy for infopath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you check Configure InfoPath Forms Services is set to Allow user form templates to use authentication information contained in data connection files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should work. EVENT ID 5566 should go away. Kerberos crowd, you’re welcome.   Love Nando&lt;/p&gt;

So if the right steps are followed, you should be able to reset the sync service and related databases, without harming the user profile data. Here are a set of suggested steps: 1) Login as farm account 2) Backup the User Profile DB and the User Profile Sync DB 3) Stop the SharePoint 2010 Timer service: PS D:\&amp;gt; net stop sptimerv4 4) Delete the data in the Sync DB using the following PowerShell script: PS D:\&amp;gt; Get-SPDatabase 5) Copy the GUID associated with the User Profile Sync DB in the command line below PS D:\&amp;gt; $syncdb=Get-SPDatabase -Id 6) Execute these commands, in exactly the following order. This is not a script. So please cut and paste each of these commands one by one. PS D:\&amp;gt; $syncdb.Unprovision() PS D:\&amp;gt; $syncdb.Status=’Offline’ PS D:\&amp;gt; Get-SPServiceApplication #Copy the GUID associated with the User Profile Service and paste it after “Id” in the next command: PS D:\&amp;gt; $upa=Get-SPServiceApplication -Id $upa.ResetSynchronizationMachine() PS D:\&amp;gt; $upa.ResetSynchronizationDatabase() 7) Provision the Sync DB: PS D:\&amp;gt; $syncdb.Provision( ) 8 ) Add the User Profile Synchronization service account (farm account) as the dbowner on the Sync DB (using SQL Server Management Studio). 9 ) Start the SharePoint 2010 Timer service PS D:\&amp;gt; net start sptimerv4 10) Start the User Profile Synchronization Service in the Central Administration UI. 11) After the User Profile Synchronization Service is started, reset IIS. PS D:\&amp;gt; iisreset 12) Create connections to data sources in the Central Administration UI. 13) Run full user profile synchronization.&lt;/p&gt;

Well they officially changed their mind about, at least for the next version. Microsoft updated it’s blog post with the following: “As part of the update shared around the Evolution of SharePoint and the next SharePoint Server on-premises release, we are also updating the timelines for removal of InfoPath Forms Services components of SharePoint and SharePoint Online. Specifically, InfoPath Forms Services will be included in the next on-premises release of SharePoint Server 2016, as well as being fully supported in Office 365 until further notice. Customers will be able to confidently migrate to SharePoint Server 2016 knowing that their InfoPath forms will continue to work in their on-premises environments, as well as in Office 365. The InfoPath 2013 application remains the last version to be released and will work with SharePoint Server 2016.” Here is the link &lt;a href=&#34;http://absolute-sharepoint.com/2015/02/infopath-back-sharepoint-2016-fosl-vnext-dead.html?utm\_content=buffer6b065&amp;amp;utm\_medium=social&amp;amp;utm\_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm\_campaign=buffer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://absolute-sharepoint.com/2015/02/infopath-back-sharepoint-2016-fosl-vnext-dead.html?utm\_content=buffer6b065&amp;amp;utm\_medium=social&amp;amp;utm\_source=twitter.com&amp;amp;utm\_campaign=buffer&lt;/a&gt; So, in honor of InfoPath’s Ali like return to the ring, i say unto you, InfoPath on my people.

Here is another one: Upon migrating my farm to new location and hardware, it was noted that alerts where still pointing to the old farm. How do iyou fix this? Well the good people over at the msdn forums pointed me in the direction of the sql table that all alert subscriptions are housed: immedSubscriptions. Below is linkage that shows you how to change the alerts to point to the new farm. On a side note, always use the alternate access map name and not the server name. Trust me it will save you a huge headache later.   &lt;a href=&#34;http://trycatch.be/blogs/tom/archive/2008/05/12/alerts-don-t-work-after-url-change.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://trycatch.be/blogs/tom/archive/2008/05/12/alerts-don-t-work-after-url-change.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://trycatch.be/blogs/tom/archive/2008/05/12/alerts-don-t-work-after-url-change.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://trycatch.be/blogs/tom/archive/2008/05/12/alerts-don-t-work-after-url-change.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://trycatch.be/blogs/tom/archive/2008/05/12/alerts-don-t-work-after-url-change.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://trycatch.be/blogs/tom/archive/2008/05/12/alerts-don-t-work-after-url-change.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://trycatch.be/blogs/tom/archive/2008/05/12/alerts-don-t-work-after-url-change.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://trycatch.be/blogs/tom/archive/2008/05/12/alerts-don-t-work-after-url-change.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://trycatch.be/blogs/tom/archive/2008/05/12/alerts-don-t-work-after-url-change.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://trycatch.be/blogs/tom/archive/2008/05/12/alerts-don-t-work-after-url-change.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
::qa::lurn::qa::New Sharepoint Dojo::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2009/04/30/new-sharepoint-dojo/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;I originally started this site over on tumblr.com. I decided to move it over to wordpress and play with the big boys. I guess i felt that tumblr was kind of limited in what i could do, and a sharepoint blog just seemed out of place with what everyone was doing over there. Hopefully, I can be more visible here and help more folks out. If you live in the Portland area and would like to talk shop, I wanna hear from you. Dont be shy, I don’t bite…….hard. j/k.

Who here that reads this blog agrees that Sharepoint is the wave of the future? ME ME ME! I have built a reputation based on that mantra, and would like to explore new worlds and new civilizations, and boldly…wait, I heard that before somewhere. MESSAGE TO THE SHAREPOINT WORLD: I AM HERE, I AM AVAILABLE, LET’S DO SOME SHAREPOINT PROJECTS!&lt;/p&gt;
::qa::lurn::qa::Newsletters on sharepoint::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2008/11/06/newsletters-on-sharepoint/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;Found this great webpart that turns sharepoint into a newsletter manager. I will post results of it usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
::qa::lurn::qa::NLB 2008 and Moss 2007::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2009/02/18/nlb-2008-and-moss-2007/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;Implementing an NLB cluster with windows 2008 and Moss 2007 isn’t as easy you think, especially if you are trying to access the NLB cluster from a different subnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to MS you must add the default gateway to the local arp table of the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original command would be arp -s but more than likely you will get an access denied or unable to create arp entry error 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way around this is to use the Netsh command to connect to the IPV4 lac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the specific steps:&lt;br&gt;step1: type cmd then ctrl + shift + enter to get admin privilege&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;step2: I am assuming that you want to bind you default gateway’s ip with its mac. so just get the mac address of that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;normally it could be find under web entry eg &lt;a href=&#34;http://192.168.0.1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://192.168.0.1&lt;/a&gt; or have a look at you device mannual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;step3: in the cmd windows, type&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;netsh -c “interface ipv4”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this command is going to enter the the configuration context under interface ipv4, then you will see the prompty become like ‘netsh interface ipv4&amp;gt;’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;step4: type —&amp;gt; set neighbors “Connection_name” “A.B.C.D” “XX-XX-XX-XX-XX-XX”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where Connection_name could be. eg, in english version of vista, it is normally be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Local Area Connection”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A.B.C.D is the ip address that you want to bind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XX-XX-….-XX-XX is the MAC address associate with A.B.C.D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;after you done this , you can check it wil arp -a, and you can see that it has be statically bind A.B.C.D to the XX-…-XX&lt;/p&gt;

On, on, you noblest English TRANSLATION ENGINE. Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof SPELLCHECK!

Be VSS SHADOW copy now to men of grosser blood, And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman, Whose SEARCH limbs were made in England, show us here, LINKS The mettle of your pasture; let us swear ON CENTRAL ADMIN That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not; For there is none of you so mean and base, That hath not noble lustre in your CONTENT DEPLOYMENT  eyes. I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips, Straining upon the start MENU.

&lt;p&gt;Here is a solution to that. The only problem is that you have to do it in a per desktop basis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OFFICE DOCUMENTS OPEN READ-ONLY IN INTERNET EXPLORER&lt;br&gt;There have been some issues with users that when they select a document link in SharePoint 2007 they do not get prompted to edit the document; instead the document opens directly in “Read Only” mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a known issue with Office 2003 and MOSS 2007, the easiest way to fix this is to install any Office 2007 component / to modify the registry keys as outlined in this MS KB article:&lt;/p&gt;

::qa::lurn::qa::SharePoint 2010 Document sets and Custom Views, yes we can!::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2011/09/09/sharepoint-2010-document-sets-and-custom-views-yes-we-can/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;Loving the document sets is hard to do if you can’t do the custom view dance. But, fear not, you can love all you want, because there is a way to achieve custom views inside of document sets. As you all probably know, if you have a document library with document sets and you create a custom view, all hell breaks loose, and sharepoint treats the document sets as filterable items. What we wanted to just sort, filter and group the items INSIDE the document sets, not the sets themselves. Microsoft did a really good job in hiding this feature from plain site. So enjoy the fruits of my laborious labor, er, searching, cuz i have found the answer. Here is how: 1. Create your custom view. Make sure you give it a descriptive name. 2. Its ok to group stuff via metadata. Don’t forget Metadata is your best friend. 3. Now comes the tricky part. Go to Library Settings and under Content Types click on the document set content type. This will bring the properties of the document set up. 4. Click on Document Set settings. This is where the magic happens. 5. Way down at the bottom, there is a Welcome Page View. In Select view, the custom view you just create in step one should be there, along with all the others. Select your view. 6. Click OK, and go back to your document set. 7. Rejoice in the love. I do have one question for you all. Do you like apples? If answer = yes How do you like them apples? Peace. Nando.&lt;/p&gt;

Further more we were constantly getting that friendly, “we are almost ready” message on the about me pages. That is strange, i thought to myself. So I went and looked at the even viewer and lo and behold the wicked critical error was there: My Site creation failure for user ‘spi\instructor’ for site url ‘&lt;a href=&#34;http://sharepoint/my/instructor&amp;#39;&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://sharepoint/my/instructor&amp;#39;&lt;/a&gt;. The exception was: Microsoft.Office.Server.UserProfiles.PersonalSiteNamingConflictException: Username conflicts with another user.. The fix to this is very simple. Check to see if the site naming format is set to resolve conflicts. To do this simply go to Central Admin&amp;gt;Application Management&amp;gt;Manage Service Applications&amp;gt; User profile Service&amp;gt; My SIte Settings&amp;gt;Setup Mysites. Halfway down the page you should see your site naming format. After i clicked on resolve conflicts, i waited a bit for the timer jobs to do their, well, jobs, and all my newsfeed and blog information was back!. Hope this helps: Nando&lt;/p&gt;
::qa::lurn::qa::SharePoint 2010 Documents Failing to upload in the morning.::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2013/10/25/sharepoint-2010-documents-failing-to-upload-in-the-morning/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;This was by far the most complex and vexing issue I have encountered in SharePoint. A little background on this first. Everyday users would get the following errors BUT ONLY IN THE MORNING!!!: &lt;a href=&#34;http://sharepointdojo.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/con1.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://sharepointdojo.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/con1.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;con1&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://sharepointdojo.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/con2.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://sharepointdojo.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/con2.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;con2&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://sharepointdojo.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/con3.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://sharepointdojo.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/con3.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;con3&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://sharepointdojo.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/con4.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://sharepointdojo.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/con4.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;con4&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   This by itself seems quite strange to begin with, so i started down the familiar troubleshooting SharePoint path, starting with event viewer, then uls, then fiddler, then pulling out my hair, then calling Microsoft and then pulling out my hair some more. I tried modifying the web config files for max upload time and ASP timeouts with no luck. I looked at Load balancing settings and that yielded a dead end. One promising direction i started going down was investigating the famed warm up script. This particular direction seemed fruitful. I wasn’t exactly sure that the warm up script was warming anything up. I asked one of my colleagues (sp dev, and a talented one) to help me create an automatic document upload script. Why an automatic upload script you ask? because after the first couple of users uploaded a document to SharePoint in the morning, the rest of the day it worked fine. So we created this band aid work around till we could figure out why it was happening. So band aid in place we continued testing with fiddler and we found this little nugget of stress: Tuesday, October 22, 2013 12:28:00 AM Start Upload &lt;a href=&#34;http://work.navigator/sites/93949/Apps/DatabaseWarm-upFile.docx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://prodservers/DatabaseWarm-upFile.docx&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday, October 22, 2013 12:29:41 AM Upload Complete.  Duration = 100.7616918 Interesting. All uploads at 12 am where taking over at 100 seconds. I looked for timer jobs that kicked off at midnight and i found quite a few, but they were default SharePoint timer jobs. I didn’t think messing with those was a road we should go down. However, looking at performance data we could NOT ignore this particular spike in IO. My dev colleague identified [dbo].[proc_UpdateStatistics as the culprit. This is the stored procedure that was causing the issue.  There is an actual health analyzer rule that kicks off this timer job. &lt;a href=&#34;http://sharepointdojo.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/analyzer.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://sharepointdojo.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/analyzer.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;analyzer&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I had never heard about this before so i took to the net to see if anyone had this problem. Thanks to Chun Liu’s blog we found this: &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/chunliu/archive/2011/11/17/auto-update-statistics-and-auto-create-statistics-on-or-off-for-sharepoint-2010-databases.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/chunliu/archive/2011/11/17/auto-update-statistics-and-auto-create-statistics-on-or-off-for-sharepoint-2010-databases.aspx&lt;/a&gt; What? I say, what? How have i been working with SharePoint this long and never heard of this at all? Needless to say, the fix that worked for us to was to set auto create statistics to false on all content databases. Be warned that this should only be done in content databases and not search ones. Resolution At midnight upload files went fro 100 seconds to 2 seconds. This took me 3 months to diagnose and fix. Enjoy this golden nugget! Learn from my fail. Nando&lt;/p&gt;
::qa::lurn::qa::SharePassion Creed::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2015/12/16/sharepassion-creed/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;The argument goes as follows,” I can’t find anything in this mess of a file share.” The answer I give is, “SharePoint can help with that!”. The reaction to that is, “SharePoint is too complex!” or “I have too much stuff to sort through!”, or something to that extent. Bro, do you even SharePoint? Why do I even bother? I’ll tell you why. Because I love what I do. I love SharePoint and what it can do. I enjoy watching the light bulb in people’s heads go off when they see what this amazing piece of technology can do for them. Yes, I am a geek and damn proud of it. No joke, I have not gone to work since 2005, when I first started working with SharePoint. Why am I telling you this? Because, I want you to know what SharePoint means to me and the many other passionate folks in the SharePoint community. These people, put in ungodly amounts of their free time, to speak and help anyone understand what it is to SharePoint. Some go under the radar and others like Todd Klindt and Christian Buckley go above and beyond to help us all out. Honestly, I am proud to know them and even call them friends. So guys, from the bottom of my ShareHeart, ShareThankYou for what you ShareDo. Shameless plug for you buddy: You wanna know SharePoint…. &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/fKNpd7jWyA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://t.co/fKNpd7jWyA&lt;/a&gt; Which brings me to the reason I was suddenly motivated to write this. Passion. It is funny that a stupid (well actually pretty good) movie about a Chef that opens a food cart in Miami, choked me up enough to tickle the keyboard. So, passion, it is why I do what I do. Anything worth doing should be done with passion. SharePoint is one of those things. It allows the technical and analytical boring side of me to merge with my goofy creative side. I love that! It makes me excited to go to work every day. It made me spend hours on google trying to find out why the UPS service gets stuck on provisioning. It made me figure out how to do an accordion mega menu for universal navigation. It even made me spend a week trying to figure out how to write a workflow that creates sub-sites on demand by using JSON calls. I feel like a dev. SharePoint is that amazing. Three completely different problems, in the same framework. It is both a science and an art and if that doesn’t get you going in the morning, then you must live in Lotus Notes land or something. On-prem or in the cloud, it doesn’t matter to me. There is a solution that needs to be crafted for someone, somewhere and I intend to make it. Us SharePoint people, we are grinders. We grind every day and I dig that about you all. Thank you very much for being there for us all and if I can be of any service, you can count on me. Here’s to more SharePassion in 2016 and beyond! I bequeath to you all the SharePassion Creed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is SharePoint. There are many like it, but this one is mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SharePoint is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SharePoint, without me, is useless. Without SharePoint, I am useless. I must configure SharePoint true. I must not use the configuration wizard. I must use powershell, I will…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SharePoint and I know that what counts in the farm is metadata, not the folders they want, nor sub sites they say they need. We know that it is search that count. We will search…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SharePoint is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its web parts, its accessories, its workflow engine and its API. I will keep SharePoint clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before God, I swear this creed. SharePoint and I are the defenders of the information. We are the masters of our data. We are the saviors of documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So be it, until there are no more folders and there isn’t 1 content database that holds 5000 sites, but clean flat metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you Microsoft for keeping it On Prem! Nando&lt;/p&gt;

The instructions are pretty straight forward. Thanks to Rehman Gul for the easy to read instructions. Steps can be found here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://rehmangul.wordpress.com/2009/12/08/installing-sharepoint-2010-on-windows-7/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://rehmangul.wordpress.com/2009/12/08/installing-sharepoint-2010-on-windows-7/&lt;/a&gt; Just so you guys know, if you are running windows 7 professional, the only prereqs to install is the MS Filter Pack. All the other downloads are useless. Run the command line IIS install config and add the NON HTTP Activation under .net 3.5. Add the line in the config file and you are ready to go. Your installation may fail the first time but if you run it again it will successfully complete. I didn’t even have to reboot. There you have it folks. Now you can take SP2010 with you on your laptops&lt;/p&gt;

I have it and the Dojo will be updating on everything the Dojo does with it. So far, my plan is to install it on my smoking hot Studio 16 Laptop with Win7 pro on it.

::qa::lurn::qa::Sharepoint 2010 profile sync. Microsoft, really? I mean, really?::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2010/10/27/sharepoint-2010-profile-sync-microsoft-really-i-mean-really/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;Trying to get profile sync to work is like trying to convince an 8 year old brussel sprouts are yummy. Cuz they aren’t yummy at all, but they are apparently good for you. Damn you nature. Thanks to Scott Ellis for uncovering this mystery. Dude knows his shizzle! So onto relevance. Getting profile sync to work on sharepoint 2010. Here is how: &lt;strong&gt;Preparing SharePoint for Profile Sync&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once installation is complete we want to add the SQL, SPAdmin, and SPFarm accounts to Managed Accounts. Prior to the next step.  Also make sure SPFarm is a local admin on the APP Server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From Central Administration, we will then create two new Web Applications (my.sharepointsite.com &amp;amp; sharepointsite.com)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When creating the first one it does not matter the order, also create a Application Pool named SharePoint Content using the Domain\SPAdmin Managed Account. When creating the second one, select the existing application pool (SharePoint Content).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the my.tripwire.com web application create a site collection using the My Site Host template. We also enable self service site creation at this stage, to ensure no errors in the future. If you go to the mysite web app you will get an error stating the User Profile Service is not available. This is the expected behaviour at this point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create the UPS Service Application&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Central Admin, go to Application Management, Manage service applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the Ribbon, click New, followed by User Profile Service Application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give it a Name of “User Profile Sync Service Application”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new App Pool “SharePoint Web Services Default” and use the TSS\SPAdmin managed account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accept the defaults for the three Databases (as this follows our naming convention)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the machine in the farm running FIM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the URL of the mysite host&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accept the Managed Path, and site naming scheme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Create, and wait while the Service Application, Service Connection and Databases are created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configuration of User Profile Sync related SharePoint Services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Central Administration, System Settings, Manage Services on server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the machine in the farm in which UPS will be running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the User Profile Service (no options) (if not already started)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start the User Profile Sync Service (you will get a configuration window)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the Service App “SharePoint Web Services Default”  you created in the previous section&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the Farm Account password and click OK. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(if the Farm Admin Account is not here at this time…..danger. This will fail…….STOP and Contact your Consultant.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Otherwise this will take 20 minutes sometimes to validate…Wait&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even though the screen returns immediately the status for the UPS Service will show starting for a while.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s provisioning the FIM services and a bunch of other stuff – baseline time is 240 seconds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once it no longer shows STARTING.  Move to the next step…not before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An IIS Reset is required if central admin is on the same box as FIM. I recommend a restart to the Server at this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once it’s sorted you can see in services.msc that the two FIM services are running as the farm account, you can run MIISclient (C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office Servers\14.0\Synchronization Service\UIShell\ and run MSIISClient.exe) and it will connect etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can now remove the Farm account from local administrators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depending upon your machine/farm configuration you will also need to enable inbound network connections to MSDTC on (PDXWeb06). This step is only needed if you are running a named instance of SQL Server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can now Configure the connection and do a sync.  But this can all be done from Central Administration.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From Central Administration, Application Management, Manage Service Applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click to the right of the UPS Service App and then the Manage button on the Ribbon bar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Synchronization Area, we want to create a new Configure Synchronization Connections&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Create New Connection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a solid naming convention (Connection to AD 2003)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the Type (Active Directory)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the Forest Name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose Windows Authentication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter the Domain\SPProfileSync account credentials for the connection (this is the important bit – this is the credential set leveraged by FIM to replicate and communicate to AD)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the Populate button, and this will test the credentials entered and show a Container Hierarchy tree view.&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don’t get a result the above information is not right, recheck the Forest, or the SPProfileSync Credentials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the TSS Domain, you should see your OU’s, select a OU! You now want to review and select the correct OU.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See that Select All button? DO NOT SELECT ALL ____EVER!  You get EVERYTHING.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save the connection by clicking OK. Your connection will be saved and you will be returned to the manage connections page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate back to Manage Profile Service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Synchronization Section click Start Profile Synchronization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the Start Profile Synchronization page, click OK.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refresh the Manage Profile Service Page, you will see the progress on the right hand side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now wait, this can take a long time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click the details link to see the Manage Profile Service page DO NOT automatically refresh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also see progress by running miisclient.exe if you have that still up and running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note that sync has stages, MIIS will report its complete, but SharePoint still has work to do. Be patient! Even for a import there are eight stages, each of which will be reported in the pop up dialog.   This can be a long process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once it’s complete you will see your imported profiles in the Profiles status on the top right and also in the Manage User Profiles page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this help you all. It did for me. it does take a couple of tries to get the hang of it. Nando&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post migration sync (No way to migrate again. If template already chosen or not blank)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No support between farms of different builds and versions. Have to be exact same version number (This may be different in 2010).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No ability to target a specific content without manual intervention (limiting all others or setting capacity high)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list is in progress.  Feel free to ping me on twitter to update or add things on this list.  I’ve added text such as “need more detail” where I don’t know the exact issue and could use clarification. Question any vendor tool that says they do full fidelity migrations since much of this list is not available in the Content Migration API.  How are they doing? That’s the follow up question.  You do have the ability to retain the GUIDs the Object IDs and as a developer using the content migration API you have the ability to target migrations at the list level.  What about SharePoint Designer?  It uses the same API and has all the limitations above plus it’s own scale limitations for size of CMP files. Some of the known issues around SPD scale are listed won’t fix. Both WSS and MOSS in 2007 and as well in 2010 you’ll see a lot of use of this API at various different places:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content Deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;STSADM -o export and import&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy/Move operations in Site Manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows Powershell cmdlet import/export&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unattached recovery uses a form of the migration API in SharePoint 2010&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s fixed with content migration in 2010? Well, the unattached recovery gives us a new API for interacting with a database that’s not apart of the farm, but ultimately I’ve found a lot of the same issues.  Try to recover a site and a workflow for example.  You do get more granularity in recovery if you can find what was lost.  Powershell export can give you more granularity, but the data faces a lot of the same issues.

::qa::lurn::qa::SharePoint 2013 and office web apps; the hidden truth about how to install!::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2013/07/23/sharepoint-2013-and-office-web-apps-the-hidden-truth-about-how-to-install/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;I make it a habit to write about things that trip me up about SharePoint and almost always, I have had a pretty good idea as to why. But, this time I have come across something that I do not understand. OFFICE WEB APPS 2013 DOES NOT LIKE TO BE INSTALLED ON ANYTHING BUT THE C DRIVE. Yes ladies and gentlemen, installing office web apps 2013 on the d: drive will not fully work. Word Web app will start to work and then hang for 5 minutes and tell you that the service is busy. The only known fix that i have come across is to uninstall owa, unbind, then reinstall on the c drive, rebind and bingo it works. Why? I have no idea. Hope this helps you guys out. Nando&lt;/p&gt;
::qa::lurn::qa::SharePoint 2013 and Office WebApps: The Binding Dance Off!::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2013/02/03/sharepoint-2013-and-office-webapps-the-binding-dance-off/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;After installing SharePoint 2013 and configuring it with Workflows and app domains, the last piece of the puzzle is to install Office web apps. Pretty simple really if you follow these steps from SOWMYANCS :&lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/sowmyancs/archive/2012/10/29/install-configure-amp-monitor-office-web-apps-2013-for-sp-2013.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Install, Configure &amp;amp; Monitor Office Web Apps 2013 for SP 2013&lt;/a&gt; However, no matter what i tried, i couldn’t get office web apps to work quite right. It wanted to launch in the window, but it would get stuck there for 5 minutes then tell me the office webapp service was busy or this dandy error: Word Document: “Sorry, Word Web App can’t open this document because the service is busy.  Please try again later.” Word Document : “Sorry, there was a problem and we can’t open this document. If this happens again, try opening the document in Microsoft Word.” I scoured the internet and nothing. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then it dawns on me. I had demoted this server from being a Domain Controller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Somewhere in the instructions i had read that OWA server cannot be a domain controller. But it doesn’t say it should have NEVER been one either. I went ahead and installed a fresh copy of Windows Server 2012 with all the updates. I went back to my SharePoint WFE and ran:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remove-SPWOPIBinding –All:$true&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I re ran the steps from the above article&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New-OfficeWebAppsFarm –InternalURL “&lt;a href=&#34;http://servername&amp;quot;&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://servername&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; -ExternalURL “&lt;a href=&#34;http://servername.contoso.com&amp;quot;&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://servername.contoso.com&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; –AllowHttp -EditingEnabled&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it STILL DID NOT WORK CORRECTLY. Hmmmm… Turns out that SharePoint remembers all your SPWPIzones from before. So if you wan’t external access you need to run this command to make sure you know what zone you are in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get-SPWOPIZone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then make sure you set your spopizone to external by running this command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set-SPWOPIZone –zone “external-https”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it works. Moral of the story, don’t reuse domain controllers, even if you have demoted them. They will always be bitter you demoted them. Nando&lt;/p&gt;
::qa::lurn::qa::SharePoint 2013 App Domains...like wrangling a 5 year old!::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2013/01/26/sharepoint-2013-app-domains-like-wrangling-a-5-year-old/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;SharePoint 2013 has many awesome qualities which i will be discussing with you later, but there are some that give me that old UPS feeling of ineptitude. Yes folks, I am talking about deploying SharePoint Apps on a private hosted App Domain on SharePoint 2013. This has to be the most problematic thing since the UPS Episode of ‘10. There are many nice MSDN articles on how to setup an app domain , but the most comprehensive one i have seen is this one: &lt;a href=&#34;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/apps/fp179923%28v=office.15%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/apps/fp179923%28v=office.15%29&lt;/a&gt; Now. What they don’t tell you is that once you set it up all kinds of things will go wrong when they can go wrong. The most two frustrating ones for me where in Visual Studio: Unable to connect to SharePoint Dev site for debugging. I fixed that one by adding a host entry. The second one is the most vexing of all: Error 1 Error occurred in deployment step ‘Install App for SharePoint’: Failed to install App for SharePoint. I know it worked like 1 day ago. But it threw this at me like an un-catchable frisbee . So i search the event log and say a bunch of these suckers: The event viewer had an error occurring every minute – Event ID 6482 which states: Application Server Administration job failed for service instance Microsoft.Office.Server.Search.Administration.SearchServiceInstance (21e4447f-bac6-4a29-82db-165e074ac5db). Reason: An update conflict has occurred, and you must re-try this action. The object SearchDataAccessServiceInstance was updated by domain\user, in the OWSTIMER (5040) process, on machine (server name). View the tracing log for more information about the conflict. Technical Support Details: Microsoft.SharePoint.Administration.SPUpdatedConcurrencyException: An update conflict has occurred, and you must re-try this action. The object SearchDataAccessServiceInstance was updated by domain\user, in the OWSTIMER (5040) process, on machine (server name). View the tracing log for more information about the conflict. at Microsoft.Office.Server.Search.Administration.SearchServiceInstance.Synchronize() at Microsoft.Office.Server.Administration.ApplicationServerJob.ProvisionLocalSharedServiceInstances(Boolean isAdministrationServiceJob) Yeah, I know right!? What the flagnog is that about? So i did some googling and found the reason for this. The file system cache on all FE’s on which the timer service is running needs to be cleared. Iam not sure why it needs to be cleared? But it does. Below is the step by step provided by Microsoft: Stop the Windows SharePoint Services Timer service (Found in Windows Services) Navigate to the cache folder In Windows Server 2008, the configuration cache is in the following location: Drive:\ProgramData\Microsoft\SharePoint\Config In Windows Server 2003, the configuration cache is in the following location: Drive:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\SharePoint\Config Locate the folder that has the file “Cache.ini” (Note: The Application Data folder may be hidden. To view the hidden folder, change the folder options as required) Back up the Cache.ini file. Delete all the XML configuration files in the GUID folder. Do this so that you can verify that the GUID folder is replaced by new XML configuration files when the cache is rebuilt. Note When you empty the configuration cache in the GUID folder, make sure that you do not delete the GUID folder and the Cache.ini file that is located in the GUID folder. Double-click the Cache.ini file. On the Edit menu, click Select All. On the Edit menu, click Delete. Type 1, and then click Save on the File menu. On the File menu, click Exit. Start the Windows SharePoint Services Timer service Note The file system cache is re-created after you perform this procedure. Make sure that you perform this procedure on all servers in the server farm. Make sure that the Cache.ini file in the GUID folder now contains its previous value. For example, make sure that the value of the Cache.ini file is not 1. Dont ask me why it works, because, well, i don’t work for microsoft. But it worked. After that i was able to deploy all my apps no problemo. Enjoy My Fail. Nando&lt;/p&gt;

The cloud is omni present and any traces of on premis SharePoint is cleverly resigned to the fine print. “Come to our booth and learn about this cool O365 plugin!”, was a line a heard quite a bit. Naturally I asked about on prem and ubiquitous answer was, “oh yeah we do that too.” But now, Mr.Baer is about to make all our dreams come true with 2016. The anticipation is palpable.

So what did I learn about SharePoint 2016? Well its going to be awesome. No down time patching, which makes me very happy. DOCID type technology that follows the document all over the farm.The link never changes! Built on SharePoint 2013 base technology. The ability to connect to office graphy online! I am super excited about it all. More to come. Nando.&lt;/p&gt;

::qa::lurn::qa::SharePoint 2016 more delicious with cinnaMINROLES; Now with FP1::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2017/06/13/sharepoint-2016-more-delicious-with-cinnaminroles-now-with-fp1/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;If you have been following Dojo for the last few weeks, you may have noticed that I have been riding the Sp2016 Ship lately. Not sure if that came across or not. One of the most talked about new features in 2016 is the new MinRole topology. I could point you to the official Microsoft documentation, but instead, you should all go to Spencer Harbar’s blog. His indepth knowledge is quite invaluable. So why MinRole you ask? 3 words…ZERO DOWNTIME PATCHING (maybe its 4?). Well, that’s the best thing for someone like me, but there are tons of other reasons why you want MinRoles. Spencer has 2 great articles that you should read before you continue here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, now that I am done brownosing that English dude, the reason for this post was to enlighten you on some not so obvious things, specifically around Feature Pack 1. Feature Packs are like the new old Service Packs and they come in a few flavors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;language independant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;language dependant&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November of 2016 Microsoft released the first Feature Pack for SharePoint 2016. You can read all about the cool new features it comes here : &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwi54fvvsbvUAhUU3mMKHaJRAxkQFggoMAA&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.office.com%2F2016%2F09%2F26%2Fannouncing-feature-pack-1-for-sharepoint-server-2016-cloud-born-and-future-proof%2F&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEqZAdv7c3F8MuTAtcN_61nMszEew&amp;amp;sig2=0d-utNAqhbkZ9Sje3pot3Q&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Feature Pack 1&lt;/a&gt;. Today’s post is about MinRoles and the difference between pre and post FP1 topologies. Before FP1 your minimum supported MinRole configuration had to be 4 SharePoint Servers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;application&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;web front end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;distributed cache - yup, you heard right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For High availability  you needed 8 servers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 applications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 wfe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 distributed cache…ugh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, after FP1 that all changed as Microsoft introduced the concept of shared roles. This means you can now combine, application with search, distributed cache with front ends, and custom anything  you want. The minimu supported MinRole config is now just 2 servers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;application + search&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wfe + distributed cache.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For full HA all you need now are 4 SharePoint Servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 app searches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 WFE + Distributed Cache.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not bad Microsfot, not bad at all! Just thought I would let yall know. If you didn’t already. WHich you probably did, but just in case. Nando&lt;/p&gt;

::qa::lurn::qa::REST API? More like UNREST! Duplicate list names break you!::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2016/06/08/rest-api-more-like-unrest-duplicate-list-names-break-you/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;Lesson learned! So for the last two days i have been tackling what i thought was a powerpivot issue. But it wasn’t. Suddenly all powerpivot refreshes broke. Why? Because of a migration. Why? Now that is the million dollar question. Going through all the troubleshooting steps for powerpivot, I came across this gem of an error: Error Message: ============================ The remote server returned an error: (500) Internal Server Error. ============================ Call Stack: ============================ at Microsoft.AnalysisServices.Common.DataSourceBasic.UpdateDataFeedParameters(ConnectionStringBuilder connBuilder, IDataSource dataSource, Boolean checkFeedValid) at Microsoft.AnalysisServices.Common.DataSourceBasic.GetCurrentConnectionString(Boolean checkFeedValid) at Microsoft.AnalysisServices.Common.DataSourceBasic.ClickTestConnection(Object progressControl) ============================ So naturally i googled the bejesus out of this and found some reference to illegal characters. But that wasn’t the answer. It was close but not quite. It turns out that you CANNOT have duplicate List names in the same site. This includes Document libraries and list combinations. During the migration, a list was brought over that had the same name as an existing library. This was a tough one to diagnose and worthy of a DOJO post. Enjoy Nando&lt;/p&gt;
::qa::lurn::qa::Sharepoint List Archiving::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2010/01/25/sharepoint-list-archiving/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;I  have been struggling with the idea of archiving in sharepoint for quite some time. I really haven’t found a clean solutions for it, so if anyone reading this can point me in the right direction, go for it. This is how I envision list archiving: 1. list is created. 2. list is populated 3. after list hits a certain magic number of items it automatically moves the oldest items to an archive of some sort. Short of a complex solution involving custom code with an event trigger, the only other solutions is this: Save the list as a template. Move list to archive area. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

Obviously I should have stapled it to my master page before pushign it out, but as usual I suck. So i decided to break out the old PowerShell machina and take a crack at it. I found a bunch of sites that showed how to do this for all SUBSITES in a Site Collection, but not all Site Collections and subsites. Here is what I came up. Hope it works for you guys. This code is as is and I don’t take any responsibility for screwing up your farm. $sitelogo=”_SPSITE where your logo resides usually &lt;em&gt;layouts/site assets/“&lt;/em&gt; $Site=”&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://rootsite&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://rootsite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;“ $Sites=Get-SPWebApplication $Site|Get-SPSite -Limit All |Get-SPWeb -Limit All|Select URL $Sites|ForEach-Object { $CurrentSite=$_.URL $CurrentSiteObject=new-object Microsoft.SharePoint.SPSite($CurrentSite) foreach($web in $CurrentSiteObject.Allwebs) { $web.SiteLogoUrl=$sitelogo $web.Update()} $CurrentSiteObject.Dispose()} Happy SharePointing! KTHANKSBYE Nando&lt;/p&gt;
::qa::lurn::qa::Sharepoint Profiles; Only enabled users please!::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2008/10/23/sharepoint-profiles-only-enabled-users-please/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;Moss 2007 is not smart enough to read my mind! What’s up with that! When i want to import user profiles into SP, what i really mean is only import people that are active in AD and delete them if their account is disabled. Is that so much to ask for? Apparently so.&lt;br&gt;But fear not here is how you do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you microsoft for making me search!&lt;/p&gt;

::qa::lurn::qa::SP 2010 Disabling site Publishing Feature = Fail::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2012/06/14/sp-2010-disabling-site-publishing-feature-fail/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;So here I am, trying to figure out how to create a page template. Of course SharePoint doesn’t like you to save things as templates if you have the publishing feature turned on ( i knew why, but the momentary laps in judgement due to my add, made me forget). So what do I do? Like a total noob, i go and disable publshing feature. No Suup forrr JU! - soup nazi. Errors all over the place. So naturally I said oops and tried to re enable it. It doesn’t scream at me. But alas, the New Page Button is gone from the site actions menu. Minor inconvenience i guess…but no it isn’t. There is more. I navigate to the Pages library to confirm its still there and it is. So i decide to create a new page and it does. But when i try to check it in i get: -Invalid SPListItem. The SPListItem provided is not compatible with a Publishing Page.- And a bunch of red /. Panic starts to set it. But then I remembered something Yoda once said. Ok there are many things Yoda said that apply here, but none rang more true than: &lt;strong&gt;May the Force be with you.&lt;/strong&gt; Powershell is a life saver. I did a quick search on syntax and ran these very commands: PS C:\Users\spfarmadmin&amp;gt;Disable-spfeature Publishing -url &lt;a href=&#34;http://yoursite/subsite&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://yoursite/subsite&lt;/a&gt; -force PS C:\Users\spfarmadmin&amp;gt; Enable-spfeature Publishing -url &lt;a href=&#34;http://yoursite/subsite&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://yoursite/subsite&lt;/a&gt; -force   Everything is back to normal. New Page button is back. Now if i can only -force myself to stop doing stupid things in SharePoint, I would be set. But then you guys wouldn’t have anything to read about. Allrightythen. Peace Nando&lt;/p&gt;

During my days as a semi-professional paintball player i did a lot of design work, some which can be seen in Greg Hastings Paintball 2. So i like to design cool tshirts on the side, big deal. But now it has spilled into the SharePoint Arena. I feel there is a lack of cool SharePoint themed Tshirts.

I am of course I am assuming that you have a clean sharepoint 2010 installation. If not, its probably a good idea to start there. Once that is up and running, here is what you can do:   1) Find the content Database; These are listed under Central Admin-&amp;gt;Application Management-&amp;gt;Site Collection List 2) Backup the content database, You could alternatively detach it, and copy it. Just doing a backup in SQL Server Management studio is easier. 3) Restore content database to new server, Copy the BAK file to new server. Create an empty DB in Management Studio, restore from backup, you may need to change an option in the “options” tab of the restore dialog to get it to work. (Overwrite db). 4) Create Web App on SharePoint 2010 5) Remove Content Database from the new web app. Now use STSADM to add restored DB to this web app c:\program files\common files\microsoft shared\web server extentions\14\bin on new server is where you can find the STSADM. run this command from there. Which will upgrade the content db to 2010? stsadm -o addcontentdb -url &lt;a href=&#34;http://yourwebapp:port&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://yourwebapp:port&lt;/a&gt; -databasename yourcontentdb -databaseserver yoursqlserver 6) Run ISSRESET from command prompt 7) Sigh in relief nothing broke. Have fun and remember always be SP safe. nando&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, I am in possession of one BIG SharePoint 2013 farm with a total of 24 server between prod, sys and dev. The production farm is a 9 SP farm behemoth. So it began with a simple enough requirement, please demo SharePoint 2013 workflows. I said OK and tried to create one. Nope. Tried another site. Nope. Spent 6 hours on the phone with Premier. Nope. Slept on it and guess what occurred to me. I should check all WFE to see if they have workflow manager CLIENT installed. They didn’t. Now they do. Tried workflows again. YUP. They work.

I came across this little golden nugget of info after installing an app domain with a host header web application: *Important – please note that if you are using Host Headers for your Web Application then you will need to create a new Web Application on port 80 that doesn’t use Host Headers. This Web App must have a root site collection which can be of any template. If you don’t do this then when you try to click on an App you will be met with a 404 error. This is because SharePoint uses the site running on Port 80 to resolve the app url, this must be a SharePoint site so the Default Web Site won’t work. Once you have created the Web Application and blank Site Collection do an IISRESET just to be sure. For more details on this check out Mirjam’s post here. What is up with that?&lt;/p&gt;

::qa::lurn::qa::SQL 2k8 Cluster nightmare.::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2008/12/14/sql-2k8-cluster-nightmare/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;3 days. That’s how long it took to install windows 2008 enterprise, clustered it, then install SQL 2k8 and clustering it.&lt;br&gt;You would think it would be very straightforward, but no, it wasn’t. Sigh. Microsoft, you hosed me again. Thats 72 hours of my life I will never get back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what happened?&lt;br&gt;Well for starers the sql installation would not pass verification because of a virtual cluster adapter that was getting a MS private network ip (169). But when you tried to go disable it, it was nowhere to be found in the networking sharing center. It shows up in the ipconfig all, but nowhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems it was populating the ipv6 ip address segment as mentioned before.&lt;br&gt;So we had to break the cluster and reinstall. Took us like 4 hours to figure that out.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we are chugging along and installing sql no problems. We get to end and fail…again.&lt;br&gt;For some reason the sql agent service won’t start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We checked everything and on a hunch i went to see if the cluster sql account was made in the AD users and computers. Sure enough it wasn’t.&lt;br&gt;Weird.&lt;br&gt;Still haven’t figured out why.&lt;br&gt;So we have to rebuild another cluster, cuz we can’t uninstall sql, cuz the damn verification system keeps failing. AAAAAAAAAAARGH.&lt;br&gt;So we finally install sql 2k8 cluster, and the computer account is created. But its still not working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am about to blow up the computer room with some c4. Seriously.&lt;br&gt;So on a second whim, we decide to see if the computer cluster account has access to create computer objects.&lt;br&gt;IT DID NOT. SO WE ENABLED THE SQL CLUSTER COMPUTER ACCOUNT TO CREATE COMPUTER OBJECTS AND BOOM IT WORKS.&lt;br&gt;But why didn’t it do it from the start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am baffled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you install it on the sharepoint front end of your choice it all goes away. So FYI people, SharePoint 2010 has to be installed on the same server as your SSRS along with all the other prerequisites. Rookie move. I know. Nando&lt;/p&gt;

::qa::lurn::qa::Task Pad Views in Sharepoint::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2008/12/02/task-pad-views-in-sharepoint/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;So i was thinking to myself, why not have custom AD task pad views in sharepoint. Theoretically i can be done. So i am trying this to see how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing I did becuase I lacked imagination, was to create the task pad view and upload it to a shared document library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out sharepoint blocks the MMC extension so had to do go into central admin to allow it. Here are the steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browse to the Central Admin site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the Operations tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under the Security Configuration section, click the link for Blocked file types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the Web Application that you would like to modify from the drop down list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each blocked file extension displayed in the list is blocked by SharePoint.  To enable the blocked file extension, simply remove it from the list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That works but it only puts the taskpad in the document library. Not too much you can do there unless you want to download it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haven’t figured out yet how to embedd the taskpad view into a webpart or if its even possible.&lt;/p&gt;

::qa::lurn::qa::The Secret Of MIM: For SharePoint 2016::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2017/06/08/the-secret-of-mim-for-sharepoint-2016/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;I promised you some war stories, and damnit, I am sorry it took an extra day to write it. MIM is a worthy adversary and I neede to get some sleep. For a quick recap visit: &lt;a href=&#34;https://sharepointdojo.wordpress.com/2017/06/05/the-secret-of-mim2016-a-ballad-of-ups/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Secret of MIM(2016). A Ballad of UPS.&lt;/a&gt; Here is the current scenario: Client has a SharePoint 2013 environment and is running UPS with both AD connections and Custom BCS connections. To my absolute horror, AD was not the source of profile info. Not that it should, but its what most people expect. Customer relies heavily on the UPS for a Staff Directory. SP UPS is the source of truth for custom employee info like, cellphone, skills, languages, interests, etc. The project is to migrate from 2013 to 2016. Easy enough right? Nope. MIM 2016 is hard, until you figure out its easy. Is started by installing and configuring MIM based on this nice post &lt;a href=&#34;http://krossfarm.com/?p=148&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Configure MIM&lt;/a&gt; by Mr WAQAS. Simple enough right? Nope. Turns out I had installed MIM 2016 with SP1. So I had some additional work to do. I should have just listened to this man: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.harbar.net/archive/2016/10/06/Microsoft-Identity-Manager-2016-Service-Pack-1-is-now-available.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Spencer Harbar.&lt;/a&gt; But being the SharePoint warrior (read idiot), I didn’t. When you use the MIMSnyc toolkit” for SharePoint 2016, with MIM SP1 upi need to update the module. If you click Spencers name uptop it will take you to the very article you need. If you are lazy and just want to read this then here is what you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download MIMSync from Github  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP-Tools/tree/master/Solutions/UserProfile.MIMSync&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MIMSYNC 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crack open the SharePoint PSM1 module in edit mode (make sure you open as admin)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit lines 80-97 so it shows new version of MIM like so:&lt;img src=&#34;https://sharepointdojo.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/mim.png&#34; alt=&#34;MIM&#34;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save that and follow the instructions on how to sync with MIM. &lt;a href=&#34;https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/33745.sharepoint-2016-user-profile-service-step-by-step-configuration-of-mim-2016.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Step By Step MIM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GOLDEN NUGGENT ADVICE 1 - MIMSYNC LOVES THE C DRIVE SO BE CAREFUL. I INSTALLED ON THE C DRIVE JUST TO BE SAFE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you followed all the instructions and didn’t mess up like I did, you should have a fully synchronized UPS with MIM.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you did screw it up or you want to add custom attributes read on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you screwed up. How do you fix MIM? This is the REAL sceret of MIM. There are tiny little nuances that you need to know about and MR Spencer Harbar, has uncovered this for us in his MIM webinar (which is 2 hours long. i love me a british accent so I sat there and took it). But if you don’t have time here is the condenced sequence of events that need to happen. GOLDEN NUGGET OF ADVICE 2: MIM LOVES, LOVES TO DO THINGS IN A SPECIFIC ORDER. First here is the order of things you need to follow to create a new Custom Property:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create the New User profile Property in the User Profile Service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a matching property in the Metaverse Designer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Map the Custom Property in the ADMA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refresh the Schema for SPMA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Map the Custom Property in the SPMA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run Full Sync&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few different ways to do the above, but Spencers way is the best. He created custom run profile for Full Import and Full Sync. Check out his webinar &lt;a href=&#34;https://rencore.com/media/webinar/recording-user-profile-synchronization-identity-manager-sharepoint-server-2016/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The MIM BIBLE.&lt;/a&gt; So I did all that. I saw the attribute in the Synchronization Statics, but it damn it Jim! it doesn’t show up in SharePoint User Profile (hair pulling ensues). See, what had happened is that when I created the new attribute, it also wanted to create a metadata term for that attribute (location is a good example). BUT, guess what? The darned termset was set to closed by default!!!! Who would know that? Well, Spencer does. So that is why I watched the whole thing. GOLDEN NUGGET ADVICE 3: IF YOU WANT YOUR CUSTOM ATTRIBUTE TO BE SEARCHABLE, YOU NEED TO CREATE CHECK , CONFIGURE A TERM TO BE USED FOR THIS PROPERTY CHECK BOX, WHEN YOU CREATE THE ATTRIBUTE IN SP, BUT YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TERMSET IS SET TO OPEN IN THE TERM STORE. &lt;img src=&#34;https://sharepointdojo.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/term.png&#34; alt=&#34;TERM&#34;&gt; BUT THAT’S NOT ENOUGH. YOU ALREADY RAN THE FULL SYNC. SO WHAT DO YOU DO NOW? GOLDEN NUGGET OF ADVICE 4 - THIS IS THE BIG ONE! TO FIX IT ALL YOU NEED TO CLICK ON THE SPMA MANAGEMENT AGENT IN MIM AND CLICK DELETE AND SELECT DELETE CONNECTOR SPACE ONLY! &lt;img src=&#34;https://sharepointdojo.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/del.png&#34; alt=&#34;DEL&#34;&gt; I wrote that in caps in order to drive home the point that this needs to be done. That, my friends is the real secret of MIM. If you screw up, you need to delete connector space only so you can continue to work. Phew…that was a lot. Learn from my fail. Once you master this, MIM will be your friend. If it’s not then, contact me and  I will see if i can help. IF i can’t I will refer you to the master. If Todd is reading this, feel free to make any necessary corrections. I may have screwed up somewhere else. Sincerely, Battle Tested Nando.&lt;/p&gt;
::qa::lurn::qa::The required feature is not enabled for this column type.::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2011/08/24/the-required-feature-is-not-enabled-for-this-column-type/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;This little gem started appearing in the last couple of days. It happened when i tried to create a managed metadata column in a sharepoint 2010 document library. Not sure why this happened, but from what i can gather, the affected sites where sites that were saved as a template. There are several different ways to get rid of this message/active it. First you need to download a really hand tool from codeplex: Sharepoint manager 2010. You can donwload it here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://spm.codeplex.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://spm.codeplex.com/&lt;/a&gt; Once you have it installed on your favorite WFE, go to the features of the site collection and search for Register taxonomy site wide field added event reviever (hidden). Right click on it and activate. [caption id=”attachment_101118315” align=”aligncenter” width=”300” caption=”sharepoint manager screen shot.”]&lt;a href=&#34;http://sharepointdojo.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/capture.png&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://sharepointdojo.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/capture.png?w=300&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Capture&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption] Go back to your DL, and refresh. Walla, metadata active! Enjoy Nando&lt;/p&gt;
::qa::lurn::qa::The Secret of MIM(2016). A Ballad of UPS.::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2017/06/05/the-secret-of-mim2016-a-ballad-of-ups/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;We have come full circle with UPS and SharePoint. The year is 2017. The players are the same. We look back fondly at 2010 where we battled with the toddler known as the User Profile Service. 7 years later, that toddler is a full blown teenager and the battle begins again. A worthy oponent this was, yet as true as the warrior is to war, I am to the UPS. I will be blogging about my hard fought battle with SharePoint 2016 with MIM 2016, custom attributes, and yes, custom connection to SQL to bring back User details. The story shall be told. Battles where lost, but the war  was won. Very special thanks to Spencer Harbar and Todd Klindt for their infiniate morsels of wisdom. That dude Spencer slayed that dragon way before I did. Stayed Tuned. For in the morrow i shall regale thee with the Secret of MIM! see what i did there…. nando&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thannks to Steven Van De Craen for his contribution:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.moss2007.be/blogs/vandest/archive/2007/08/28/sharepoint-2007-people-search-options-shown-by-default-repost.aspx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://www.moss2007.be/blogs/vandest/archive/2007/08/28/sharepoint-2007-people-search-options-shown-by-default-repost.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instructions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to the People Search Page in your SharePoint Portal and modify the page (eg. /SearchCenter/Pages/people.aspx)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a Content Editor Web Part right below the People Search Box Web Part&lt;br&gt;Add the following javascript to the CEWP:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_&lt;br&gt;var anchors = document.getElementsByTagName(“a”);&lt;br&gt;var anchor;&lt;br&gt;var j;_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// Iterate through all anchors on the page and find the one with ID ending in _PSB_Show&lt;br&gt;for (j = 0; j {&lt;br&gt;if (anchors[j].id.match(/\_PSB_Show$/) != null)&lt;br&gt;{&lt;br&gt;anchor = anchors[j];&lt;br&gt;break;&lt;br&gt;}&lt;br&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;// If the anchor is found and the click is supported in the current browser&lt;br&gt;// Perform a click after 100 ms&lt;br&gt;if ((anchor != null) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (anchor.click != null))&lt;br&gt;{&lt;br&gt;setTimeout(“anchor.click();”, 100);&lt;br&gt;}  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark the Web Part as hidden and optionally give it a friendly name.&lt;br&gt;Screenshot&lt;/p&gt;

Can sharepoint be this Awesome? Yes it can. All you need is this: This handy codeplex WSP that fixes the annoying bug in sharepoint that doesn’t totally convert folders to document sets all the way: &lt;a href=&#34;http://foldertodocsetfix.codeplex.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://foldertodocsetfix.codeplex.com/&lt;/a&gt; 2. You need to create a workflow in sharepoint designer. Choose List Item and choose the Document library/Library you want to associate the WF with. What we wan to do now is set a condition that says, “if the content type id=Folder, set contentId to Document Set. You must set the workflow to start when a new item is created. Once you have all these configured, the magic happens. Your Folder is now a document set. You can create different document set content type. Very very handy.

::qa::lurn::qa::View HTML pages in SharePoint Online.::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2014/07/23/view-html-pages-in-sharepoint-online/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;Did someone in your organization save an entire website in a document library? Did they complain they couldn’t open the start.html page? Do you have users that want to view html pages inside SharePoint online? If you answered yes to any of these questions (i am aware of the irony of this post), then I have a solution for you! Simply open your html files in your library using explorer view and change the extension from HTML to ASPX. It even works with Flash content. Yup, its that easy (and confusing at the same time, but for other reasons). Enjoy Nando&lt;/p&gt;
::qa::lurn::qa::Want to add a WFE? YOu gotta follow da rules!::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2009/08/26/want-to-add-a-wfe-you-gotta-follow-da-rules/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;WOW! Who knew that installing and additional Front end server in moss 2007 was such a headache. First all i did was install sharepoint on a virtual machine and added it to the farm. Pretty simple, right? Wrong! Central Admin decrees the new server is not configured. Well how do we go about doing that? Turns out you have to pay close attention to the version level of your Farm before you even begin. Case in point if you have installed the infrastructure update you are on version 6318, where as with SP1 you are only on version 6219. In my case i had installed the infrastructure update across the farm, so that is why i was getting the server not configured message. But even running the infrastructure update after does not work! it just stays trying to connect to the database, causing a bunch of event id 3351 to be thrown all over the place. So, here is what you do to fix this: 1. you install sharepoint with SP1 BUT DO NOT RUN THE CONFIG WIZARD! 2. you install wss infrastructure update BUT DO NOT RUN THE CONFIG WIZARD! 3. you install moss2k7 infrastructure update BUT DO NOT RUN THE CONFIG WIZARD! 4. after all this has been done run the config wizard and you are done!&lt;/p&gt;

If we can only have a quick and easy way to tell people what it is, our lives will be so much better. Do you guys have an Idea? Lets have a what is sharepoint contest. Simplest answer wins.

::qa::lurn::qa::Web Part connections=Good::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2010/02/02/web-part-connectionsgood/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;I recently finished up a project over at symantec. Part of their requirements was a sort of 3 tiered project creation dashboard. They wanted the ability to group tasks and documents to a specific list. Enter web part connections. What I ended up doing was adding a lookup field to the task list and document library, that referred back to the create a task custom list. Once I did that i was able to create a blank web part page and add the 3 lists as web parts. I then we connected them with the lookup field using the web part connections option. Now I am able to select a specific project and all the tasks and documents associated with it. Pretty nifty eh?&lt;/p&gt;
::qa::lurn::qa::Why Sharepoint?::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2008/11/28/why-sharepoint/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;I get that a lot, along with - what is sharepoint? My standard answer is basically this; Sharepoint is like a swiss army knife. It has many application and uses. It is an intranet portal, it is a centralized document repository with search function. Sometimes, I say its Microsoft office in a web form. But most of the time, showing them is better than trying to explain it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buzz words like social computing and online collaboration mean very little to those that are not fluent in the geek speak. Weird, I know. But there are actually people out there that want things in plain english.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on this later.&lt;/p&gt;
::qa::lurn::qa::Why?::qa::lurn::qa::http://yoursite.com/2008/10/17/why/::qa::lurn::qa::&lt;p&gt;I’m not really a blogger. I don’t have myspace. I do have facebook, but i don’t really check it. This seems to be a pretty good compromise. Heck, I can even do it from my iphone so this might actually work. I just need to actually include valuable content.&lt;/p&gt;
